  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I'm a self-taught tech explorer passionate about <strong>Python programming</strong>, <strong>cybersecurity</strong>, and solving complex puzzles.  
    I recently created <em>Luminaria</em> — a Cicada 3301-inspired CTF challenge blending storytelling, cryptography, steganography, and interactive files to test curiosity and logic.
  </p>
  <p>
    I learn by building. I’ve completed challenges on <strong>PicoCTF</strong> and <strong>TryHackMe</strong>, and designed immersive experiences using <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>GitHub Pages</strong>, audio editing, and command-line tools.  
    Every project helps me level up and get closer to working in tech full time.
  </p>
  <p>
    While I’m still gaining formal experience, I’m hungry to grow. Open to internships, freelance work, and junior roles. Currently offering my skills from as little as <strong>$200/month</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you'd like to support my journey or help raise funds for a new laptop, every bit counts — and I’m ready to prove what I can do.
